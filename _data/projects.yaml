  starting_point: "<p>The British Museum is home to the National Bronze Age Index: a catalogue of over 30,000 index cards that record all bronze age findings in the UK from the 1800s to the 1990s. The storage space represents a lost world, with a visitor book showing that in the past 30 years only six people visited the collection. The British Museum, in collaboration with University College London, wants to reclaim this world.</p> <p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/axes.jpeg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA technology provided the flexibility and dynamism for The British Museum to quickly create Micropasts, a bespoke platform for hosting citizen archeology projects. Our plug-in infrastructure meant electronic scans of index cards could easily be imported, then our ready-to-use PDF data-mining template enabled volunteers to transcribe the cards with ease. Humans remain superior to machines in interpreting handwriting.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>The British Museum’s index card database records details about object type, location and context of discovery, as well as line drawings of each object. Contributors to Micropasts are asked to transcribe details from the cards in pre-determined fields and to geo-reference the objects’ place of discovery. Volunteers are also asked to help create 3D models of some of the collection’s artefacts by a process known as ‘photomasking’, which involves accurately outlining the artefacts in pictures.</p>
<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>The MicroPasts crowdsourcing platform has allowed volunteers to transcribe the National Bronze Age Index catalogue, effectively turning the information contained in 30,000 index cards into one of the world’s largest electronic archaeological databases. Artefacts are also geographically referenced so that maps of their discovery sites can be generated. The creation of 3D models has allowed the British Museum to create ‘virtual tours’ of particular artefacts. By annotating models online, which creates a whole new way of presenting historical objects. Object models may also be transmitted around the world and 3D-printed for study by researchers.</p>
<p>The Micropasts platform has been used to host a multitude of projects which has powered archaeological crowdsourcing internationally.</p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/micropasts.jpeg'>"

        starting_point: "<p>The British Library is the national library of the UK and, by law, receives a copy of all publications in the UK. It is home to a vast amount of material which, for historical reasons, is only discoverable through old printed card catalogues onsite. The British Library wanted to make its collections more accessible online.</p><p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/IndexCards.jpg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>The British Library required a bespoke approach to enrich its online collection. LibCrowds is a crowdsourcing platform that aims to make the physical collections of the library accessible online. PYBOSSA’s PDF data mining template provided a ready-made solution for transcribing its vast collection of index cards. Plugins meant data could be readily uploaded to the platform. The flexibility of PYBOSSA software allowed the British Library to customise the platform to meet its unique requirements.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>Libcrowds asks volunteers to transcribe text from printed card catalogues into electronic records in order to make them available to a worldwide audience. Volunteers locate a matching record in an existing external database of online catalogue records and transcribe the unique British Library shelfmark, thereby creating a new online catalogue record for the item. Data identified, transcribed or translated as part of the project is made freely accessible from the British Library’s Explore catalogue.<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h3><p>Libcrowds has so far focused on the British Library’s Asian and African collections, particularly the Chinese, Indian and Indonesian catalogues, making these resources available online and openly accessible, revolutionizing how the library engages with readers and researchers.</p>"
