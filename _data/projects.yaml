        title: Academic paper

  starting_point: "<p>Cancer is one of mankind’s most prolific killers. Lung, trachea and bronchus cancers caused 1.7 million deaths worldwide in 2015. It is estimated that there will be 23.6 million new cases of cancer each year by 2030. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has been investigating how crowdsourcing might help in the fight against cancer, particularly in the accurate identification of cancer cells in tissue samples. CRUK found that citizen scientists struggled with distinguishing between different types of cells in images. They wanted to find out if it would be possible to boost accuracy, and enable people to analyse more complicated samples, with enhanced training and by providing more feedback to citizens.
</p><p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/CancerTutorial.png'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>Scifabric technology allowed Cancer Research UK to create Trailblazer, a customised project for identifying cancer cells. PYBOSSA software allows CRUK to retain its brand, make data private or public as required, add as many features as needed with plugin infrastructure, and automatically import data. The software provides ready-to-use templates and facilitates agile development with the release of frequent new versions. PYBOSSA also allows real-time analysis, which helps analyse results as quickly as possible, saving time, money and accelerating research.
</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>Volunteers receive 25 minutes online training on how to identify and distinguish between cancer cells in images of tissue under a microscope. They are then provided with unclassified images and asked to identify and classify cancer cells. Citizen scientist scores are compared to consensus expert analysis in order to evaluate accuracy.</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Over 1000 volunteers with no previous biomedical knowledge accessed Trailblazer. Scores showed that they could distinguish between cancer cells and healthy cells in tissue samples with 95% accuracy, as well as detect clinically significant features of cancer cells. Scores were compared against consensus expert analysis to evaluate accuracy, with volunteers' findings matching those of professional pathologists up to 90% of the time. Findings were published in the British Journal of Cancer.

  starting_point: "<p>The British Museum is home to the National Bronze Age Index: a catalogue of over 30,000 index cards that record all bronze age findings in the UK from the 1800s to the 1990s. The storage space represents a lost world, with a visitor book showing that in the past 30 years only six people visited the collection. The British Museum, in collaboration with University College London, wants to reclaim this world.</p> <p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/axes.jpeg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA technology provided the flexibility and dynamism for The British Museum to quickly create Micropasts, a bespoke platform for hosting citizen archeology projects. Our plug-in infrastructure meant electronic scans of index cards could easily be imported, then our ready-to-use PDF data-mining template enabled volunteers to transcribe the cards with ease. Humans remain superior to machines in interpreting handwriting.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>The British Museum’s index card database records details about object type, location and context of discovery, as well as line drawings of each object. Contributors to Micropasts are asked to transcribe details from the cards in pre-determined fields and to geo-reference the objects’ place of discovery. Volunteers are also asked to help create 3D models of some of the collection’s artefacts by a process known as ‘photomasking’, which involves accurately outlining the artefacts in pictures.</p>
<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>The MicroPasts crowdsourcing platform has allowed volunteers to transcribe the National Bronze Age Index catalogue, effectively turning the information contained in 30,000 index cards into one of the world’s largest electronic archaeological databases. Artefacts are also geographically referenced so that maps of their discovery sites can be generated. The creation of 3D models has allowed the British Museum to create ‘virtual tours’ of particular artefacts. By annotating models online, which creates a whole new way of presenting historical objects. Object models may also be transmitted around the world and 3D-printed for study by researchers.</p>
<p>The Micropasts platform has been used to host a multitude of projects which has powered archaeological crowdsourcing internationally.</p><p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/micropasts.jpeg'></p>"

        title: The Guardian Article

  starting_point: "<p>New South Wales (NSW) politicians are required to declare interests that may influence their decisions in Parliament in a ‘pecuniary interests register’. These may include business interests, gifts, investments, shares and directorships. Guardian Australia journalists were concerned about the transparency of the NSW pecuniary interests register as it was not easy to scrutinise, with half of the register never made available online. The other half was a jumbled mess of (often handwritten) PDFs. To view politician’s interests in their entirety, it was necessary to go to Parliament and view the register in hard copy.
</p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/journalism.jpg'>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA software provided a plugin so that PDF scans could be automatically imported to a single platform. With PYBOSSA’s PDF data mining template, tasks could be easily set-up for Guardian readers to extract key information. PYBOSSA allows real-time analysis, which helps analyse results as quickly as possible, saving time, money and accelerating an investigation.

</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>To improve transparency, journalists wanted to create an open, machine-readable database of the interests register for the 2013-14 financial year. PDF scans were uploaded to a platform, from which Guardian readers transcribed key details into a database. This was the first project of its kind in Australia at a state level.<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Guardian readers transcribed the entire pecuniary interest register in less than three weeks. Around 50 contributors completed more that 1,700 tasks and flagged entries that warranted further investigation. The resulting database may be viewed here. Data analysis techniques were employed to compare the database with other datasets, such as records of contracts, donations and travel expenses. Analysis of the register revealed that two politicians had failed to comply with transparency rules. They promptly updated the register.

  starting_point: "<p>Global overfishing is destroying ocean ecosystems. Nearly one third of marine fish stocks worldwide have been overfished and over 90% of the world’s fisheries are fully exploited or overfished according to a 2014 UN report. Global fishing fleets operate far out at sea and their activities are extremely difficult to monitor. </p><p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/fish.jpg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA’s image pattern recognition template made it the ideal tool to create Global Fishing Watch, a platform which aims to track the movements of fishing vessels. The Global Fishing Watch team has utilised PYBOSSA before, so knew how straightforward and intuitive it is to use. PYBOSSA is open source software, which made it a good cultural fit for the project.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>Almost all large ocean-going vessels are required to carry an Automatic Identification System, which periodically broadcasts a vessel’s location and identity. Satellites can use these signals to track the movements of fishing vessels. Global Fishing Watch enlists the help of volunteers to identify vessel movement that is suggestive of fishing activity. This is a pattern recognition problem and so input from citizens is crucial.</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Since the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) – a swathe of unspoilt ocean located in the central Pacific between Hawaii and Australia that is the world’s largest UNESCO World Heritage Site – was officially closed to industrial fishing, Global Fishing Watch monitors the park to ensure fishing vessels stay out.</p><p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2jeOa0HmiU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

  starting_point: "<p>The oil industry is run by massive multinational conglomerates, each composed of a dense network of companies, subsidiaries and partners. To understand the industry, it is necessary to untangle the complex contractual web that links these entities. Governments require oil companies to disclose information, including contracts, in public filings. There are huge volumes of data made publicly available in jurisdictions across the world each day.

With the help of the Crowd, data presented in a jumbled, haphazard mess of PDFs has been pulled together into a coherent, useable format that presents a holistic picture of an organisation or industry. For example, Open Oil found the multinational organisation British Petroleum to be constituted of 1,180 affiliations across 84 jurisdictions, with 12 layers of corporate ownership. The structure is so vast that BP executives got in touch with Open Oil to help them understand the company themselves!

  starting_point: "<p>The observable universe is composed almost entirely of matter but stuff called antimatter can be made in the laboratory. Antimatter is material composed of antiparticles that have the same mass as normal matter particles but the opposite electric charge. When an antiparticle collides with a normal matter particle they both annihilate – producing a burst of other particles and radiation. Scientists don’t know how antimatter interacts with gravity.</p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>Figuring out how antimatter interacts with gravity is an image pattern recognition problem. PYBOSSA’s image pattern recognition template allowed scientists at CERN – the world’s leading particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland – to create tasks whereby volunteers track the path of antiparticles as they fly through an emulsion. Plugins facilitated the easy upload of data.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>The AEgIS experiment at CERN shoots antimatter atoms horizontally – whereupon they fly and fall – at a wall made of matter. On hitting the wall, the antimatter will annihilate with a matter nucleus, producing a burst of light particles (known as pions) and some heavier particles. These particles will travel through a special gel (known as an emulsion) behind the wall which makes their tracks visible. Tracing these tracks to their point of origin reveals exactly where the annihilation occurred which, in turn, allows for the calculation of how far each antiparticle travels. From this, you can work out – from the distance each particle flies and falls – how antimatter interacts with gravity. Simples!</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>The Antimatter project was the first time CERN released previously unanalysed data publicly. The data was analysed rapidly and has helped scientists to better calibrate the experiment.

  starting_point: "<p>The NASA Johnson Space Centre database holds more than 1.2 million photographs taken by astronauts from the International Space Station. The photographs represented an information-rich but largely untapped resource.  However, a PhD candidate in Madrid realised the database may provide valuable insight into artificial light levels across the Earth’s surface.</p><p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/city.jpg'></p>"

PYBOSSA software also provided the flexibility to customise the projects to Alejandro’s needs.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>Cities at Night consists of three inter-related projects: in Dark Skies contributors identify what is observed in each image, whether stars, a city, an astronaut or simply darkness. This is a classic image pattern recognition problem, where volunteers identify objects that algorithms cannot. Images with cities are put into a separate database.  In Lost at Night, volunteers identify particular cities in the photographs by shape, notable features or using local knowledge.  Cities are geolocated on a world map. Finally, in Night Cities ISS volunteers help to match city features in the photograph with the same features shown on a web-based map. Advanced web-mapping techniques accurately georeference each image and associate it with real world coordinates.<p><img src='https://scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/Shanghai.jpg'></p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Cities at Night has attracted more than 30,000 unique contributors. Thanks to users, more than
145,000 images have been classified, geolocated and georeferenced. Georeferenced images are used to measure, monitor, compare and contrast light emitted by cities. This information is fed to governments to encourage reductions in light pollution. (Oh and Alejandro was awarded a distinction for his doctoral thesis!)
