        title: British Museum

  starting_point: "<p>The British Museum is home to the National Bronze Age Index: a catalogue of over 30,000 index cards that record all bronze age findings in the UK from the 1800s to the 1990s. The storage space represents a lost world, with a visitor book showing that in the past 30 years only six people visited the collection. The British Museum, in collaboration with University College London, wants to reclaim this world.</p> <p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/axes.jpeg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA technology provided the flexibility and dynamism for The British Museum to quickly create Micropasts, a bespoke platform for hosting citizen archeology projects. Our plug-in infrastructure meant electronic scans of index cards could easily be imported, then our ready-to-use PDF data-mining template enabled volunteers to transcribe the cards with ease. Humans remain superior to machines in interpreting handwriting.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>The British Museum’s index card database records details about object type, location and context of discovery, as well as line drawings of each object. Contributors to Micropasts are asked to transcribe details from the cards in pre-determined fields and to geo-reference the objects’ place of discovery. Volunteers are also asked to help create 3D models of some of the collection’s artefacts by a process known as ‘photomasking’, which involves accurately outlining the artefacts in pictures.</p>
<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>The MicroPasts crowdsourcing platform has allowed volunteers to transcribe the National Bronze Age Index catalogue, effectively turning the information contained in 30,000 index cards into one of the world’s largest electronic archaeological databases. Artefacts are also geographically referenced so that maps of their discovery sites can be generated. The creation of 3D models has allowed the British Museum to create ‘virtual tours’ of particular artefacts. By annotating models online, which creates a whole new way of presenting historical objects. Object models may also be transmitted around the world and 3D-printed for study by researchers.</p>
<p>The Micropasts platform has been used to host a multitude of projects which has powered archaeological crowdsourcing internationally.</p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/micropasts.jpeg'>"

        starting_point: "<p>The British Library is the national library of the UK and, by law, receives a copy of all publications in the UK. It is home to a vast amount of material which, for historical reasons, is only discoverable through old printed card catalogues onsite. The British Library wanted to make its collections more accessible online.</p><p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/IndexCards.jpg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>The British Library required a bespoke approach to enrich its online collection. LibCrowds is a crowdsourcing platform that aims to make the physical collections of the library accessible online. PYBOSSA’s PDF data mining template provided a ready-made solution for transcribing its vast collection of index cards. Plugins meant data could be readily uploaded to the platform. The flexibility of PYBOSSA software allowed the British Library to customise the platform to meet its unique requirements.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>Libcrowds asks volunteers to transcribe text from printed card catalogues into electronic records in order to make them available to a worldwide audience. Volunteers locate a matching record in an existing external database of online catalogue records and transcribe the unique British Library shelfmark, thereby creating a new online catalogue record for the item. Data identified, transcribed or translated as part of the project is made freely accessible from the British Library’s Explore catalogue.<h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h3><p>Libcrowds has so far focused on the British Library’s Asian and African collections, particularly the Chinese, Indian and Indonesian catalogues, making these resources available online and openly accessible, revolutionizing how the library engages with readers and researchers.</p>"

        title: News about the project

  starting_point: "<p>Global overfishing is destroying ocean ecosystems. Nearly one third of marine fish stocks worldwide have been overfished and over 90% of the world’s fisheries are fully exploited or overfished according to a 2014 UN report. Global fishing fleets operate far out at sea and their activities are extremely difficult to monitor. </p><p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/fish.jpg'></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA’s image pattern recognition template made it the ideal tool to create Global Fishing Watch, a platform which aims to track the movements of fishing vessels. The Global Fishing Watch team has utilised PYBOSSA before, so knew how straightforward and intuitive it is to use. PYBOSSA is open source software, which made it a good cultural fit for the project.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>Almost all large ocean-going vessels are required to carry an Automatic Identification System, which periodically broadcasts a vessel’s location and identity. Satellites can use these signals to track the movements of fishing vessels. Global Fishing Watch enlists the help of volunteers to identify vessel movement that is suggestive of fishing activity. This is a pattern recognition problem and so input from citizens is crucial.</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Since the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) – a swathe of unspoilt ocean located in the central Pacific between Hawaii and Australia that is the world’s largest UNESCO World Heritage Site – was officially closed to industrial fishing, Global Fishing Watch monitors the park to ensure fishing vessels stay out.</p><p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2jeOa0HmiU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

  starting_point: "<p>ield teams trying to stop the spread of Malaria need to deliver technologies and advice to indigenous populations to prevent them from contracting the disease. To deliver these tools, the teams need to know where people live. While they try their best to visit everyone, inevitably they miss some people out who, perhaps, live in remote areas which are difficult to access.</p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>PYBOSSA software was used to create Rural Gelocator, a platform for identifying potentially habitable dwellings in satellite images. PYBOSSA plugins allow large volumes of satellite data to be easily uploaded to the platform. The ready-to-use image pattern recognition template allows citizens to identify patterns in images. Data can be analysed in real time, allowing researchers to save time, money and accelerate research.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>The Rural Geolcator team acquired thousands of satellite images (imported from Bing) to help locate structures where people might live in specific areas. There is a diverse range of possibilities of what constitutes a ‘potentially habitable structure’ that only the human brain can interpret – computer algorithms cannot be used for these tasks. Volunteers identify and georeference potentially habitable dwellings so that field workers can visit these sites and distribute anti-Malaria technologies.</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Data sets collected for Rusinga Island, Kenya and Majete Wildlife Researcve, Malawi were used to create maps of potentially habitable structures to overlay maps of houses visited by field teams. These maps were used to identify households missed by field teams and deliver anti-Malaria technology. Using satellite imagery and crowdsourcing has improved data to guide both field research and the implementation of malaria control measures.</p><p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/enumerators.JPG'></p>"

        title: Open Oil

  starting_point: "<p>The oil industry is run by massive multinational conglomerates, each composed of a dense network of companies, subsidiaries and partners. To understand the industry, it is necessary to untangle the complex contractual web that links these entities. Governments require oil companies to disclose information, including contracts, in public filings. There are huge volumes of data made publicly available in jurisdictions across the world each day. The problem is that there is too much data for any individual or investor to understand.</p><p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/29RQWlalFfs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>Open Oil uses PYBOSSA technology to help analyse oil industry contracts. Using PYBOSSA’s PDF data-mining template, it is easy to set up projects where volunteers extract key details from documents. Plugins help upload large volumes of data efficiently. Real time analysis produces results as quickly as possible, saving time, money and accelerating research.</p>"
  how_does_it_work: "<p>Open Oil asks contributors to identify the full legal name, abbreviation, jurisdiction and OpenCorporates ID in each contract.  The ultimate objective is not just to make information available but to make it useable – to present it in a clear and accessible way that is meaningfully transparent. It may then be used to understand beneficial ownership, crack down on tax avoidance, protect public funds, hold politicians to account, monitor lobbyists and fight pollution. Open Oil has created Aleph, a search engine to easily navigate oil contract information.</p><p></p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>Open Oil believes open data can change extractive industries. With the help of the Crowd, data presented in a jumbled, haphazard mess of PDFs has been pulled together into a coherent, useable format that presents a holistic picture of an organisation or industry. For example, Open Oil found the multinational organisation British Petroleum to be constituted of 1,180 affiliations across 84 jurisdictions, with 12 layers of corporate ownership. The structure is so vast that BP executives got in touch with Open Oil to help them understand the company themselves! This profound new method of open corporate governance empowers people to hold organisations to account and insist on fair play.</p>"

  starting_point: "<p>The observable universe is composed almost entirely of matter but stuff called antimatter can be made in the laboratory. Antimatter is material composed of antiparticles that have the same mass as normal matter particles but the opposite electric charge. When an antiparticle collides with a normal matter particle they both annihilate – producing a burst of other particles and radiation. Scientists don’t know how antimatter interacts with gravity.</p>"
  what_we_did: "<p>Figuring out how antimatter interacts with gravity is an image pattern recognition problem. PYBOSSA’s image pattern recognition template allowed scientists at CERN – the world’s leading particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland – to create tasks whereby volunteers track the path of antiparticles as they fly through an emulsion. Plugins facilitated the easy upload of data.</p>"
  how_does_it_work:  "<p>The AEgIS experiment at CERN shoots antimatter atoms horizontally – whereupon they fly and fall – at a wall made of matter. On hitting the wall, the antimatter will annihilate with a matter nucleus, producing a burst of light particles (known as pions) and some heavier particles. These particles will travel through a special gel (known as an emulsion) behind the wall which makes their tracks visible. Tracing these tracks to their point of origin reveals exactly where the annihilation occurred which, in turn, allows for the calculation of how far each antiparticle travels. From this, you can work out – from the distance each particle flies and falls – how antimatter interacts with gravity. Simples!</p><h2 class='has-text-primary'>Results</h2><p>The Antimatter project was the first time CERN released previously unanalysed data publicly. The data was analysed rapidly and has helped scientists to better calibrate the experiment. Further data and results are awaited to discover if antimatter actually falls up...</p><p><img src='https://cdn.scifabric.com/assets/img/blog/AEGIS4.jpg'></p>"
