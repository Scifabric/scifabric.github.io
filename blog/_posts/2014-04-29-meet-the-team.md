It’s fair to say that it is exciting times at PyBossa. Not only did we launch our handsome
new platform on 27th March, but we have also grown from a one-man show to a five-a-
side team in just a few months. In this blog post we introduce you to some of the key
features of PyBossa 0.2.1 and to its new dedicated team.

## What is PyBossa?

PyBossa is an open source platform that allows you to create web micro-tasking
applications where volunteers can participate using their own web browsers.

It provides a framework around which crowdsourced projects can be easily constructed
allowing anyone – from researchers, to civic hackers, to developers – to connect with
people from all around the world to solve problems quickly and efficiently. Volunteers can
help with image classification, transcription, geocoding and much more.

See the PyBossa [overview](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/overview.html) for how the platform works.

## What’s so PyGreat about it?

Creating and running crowdsourced projects has never been easier and, indeed, Francois
Grey (Coordinator of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre) has declared that PyBossa 0.2.1 is
*“as close to one click crowdsourcing as the world has ever seen”*.

Some of its cool features include:

 * project-specific [template applications](http://pybossa.com/) to make your project really easy to set-up. Templates include: image, sound and video pattern recognition; transcription of
PDFs; geo-referencing; and phone-based data collection;
 * web applications delivered via a simple [RESTful API](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/api.html);
 * a simple inbuilt [task creator](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/overview.html) to construct tasks for volunteers;
 * a stylish [task presenter](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/overview.html) for exhibiting tasks with an appropriate user interface; and
 * easy-to-make [tutorials](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/user/tutorial.html) to demonstrate tasks to volunteers.
 
Oh, and did we mention it’s all open source?

## “PyBeautiful”

The new PyBossa has been described as *“PyBeautiful”* and *“PyGorgeous”* on the
Tweetosphere. And its beauty and usability extends to tablets and smartphones, so you
can work on your project on the go...

## PyBossa-powered applications

Here are a few examples of PyBossa-powered applications to whet your appetite for what
you can achieve with the platform:

[http://micropasts.org/](http://micropasts.org/) – Micropasts is a joint venture between the British Museum and
University College London which invites the public to become citizen archeologists.

[http://forestwatchers.net/](http://forestwatchers.net/) – a citizen project for monitoring deforestation.

[http://crowdcrafting.org/](http://crowdcrafting.org/) – Crowdcrafting hosts a range of crowdsourcing projects on topics
as diverse as: particle collisions at CERN; mapping light pollution from the International
Space Station; and monitoring fracking activities in the US.

## PyComplicated?

If you have a particularly challenging, complicated or large project – DON’T WORRY. The
PyBossa team (meet them below) is on hand to help you create bespoke applications
which meet your needs and those of your contributors.

## The PyTeam

Here they are, your crowdsourcing dream team:
