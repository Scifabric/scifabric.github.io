In September 2015, world leaders committed to 17 global goals that aim to end extreme poverty, fight inequality & injustice, and fix climate change by 2030. These goals address a range of challenges for sustainable development including hunger, education, inequality, energy, climate change and justice.

## How you can help

The [Open Seventeen Challenge](http://openseventeen.org/) is a joint initiative between [SciFabric](http://scifabric.com/), [Citizen Cyberlab](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/), [Govlab](http://www.thegovlab.org/) and the [One Campaign](http://www.one.org/international/), which challenges anyone to set up a project that uses open data to verify progress towards the 17 global goals at a local, regional or global level. 

## Sounds tricky

Not so. Crowdsourcing can help participants analyse large data sets through online collaborations.

## Easy as 1, 2, 3...

Projects can be set up in three easy steps. First, identify a set of open public data: this may be PDFs, photos, audio clips or tweets etc. Then define a goal with clear, measurable outcomes. Finally, pitch your idea to the [Open Seventeen Challenge](http://openseventeen.org/) by 31st December.

## Then what?

Three pitches will be chosen and offered support & guidance to set up their proposed projects. The [Govlab Academy](http://govlabacademy.org/) will help participants develop the project from idea to implementation. [SciFabric](http://scifabric.com/) will help build the project on the [Crowdcrafting](https://crowdcrafting.org/) platform. And the [One Campaign](http://www.one.org/international/) will profile the winning project at international events.

## Need inspiration?

The [Open Seventeen](http://openseventeen.org/) profiles a range of existing projects that tackle sustainable development goals. These include:

[FrackFinder](http://crowd.skytruth.org/) – mapping fracking activities across the US.

[OpenOil](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/openoil/) – better understanding corporate frameworks in the oil industry.

[Somali Drought](http://geotagx.org/project/category/somalidrought/) – assessing information about droughts using photos taken during field assessments.

[Pecuniary Interests](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2015/mar/09/help-us-investigate-the-register-of-interests-political-gifts-and-investments-in-nsw) – investigating political gifts in New South Wales.

[District Court](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/heradsdomar/) – investigating correlations between how judges vote and how often they incarcerate. 

[Forest Watchers](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) – assessing deforestation in Brazil using satellite images.

## Don’t miss the deadline!

Remember you must [submit your pitch](http://openseventeen.org/) by 31st December. Who knows... you might just change the world. Good luck!
