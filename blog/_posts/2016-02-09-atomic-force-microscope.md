Microscopes, who has not used one? Well, I hope you have, at least when you were at 
high school. Microscopes allow us to see things that our naked eyes cannot, 
opening the door to new discoveries. But, do you know when was it invented? 
How old is it?

Evidence suggests that in 1620 in Netherlands there was the first compound microscope. 
Almost 400 years ago!

Indeed! That's actually a long story, but worth it. Bear with me. 

While the microscope was invented, it didn't have a name. Huh! We'll have to wait 5 extra years to actually name it. In 1625 [Giovanni Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Faber) -a fellow of the [Lincean Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei)- coins the name *microscope* after [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) presented it one year before. The name comes from the Greek words μικρόν (micron) meaning "small", and σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning "to look at".

Now we know when it was named, but when become it popular? Well, guess what, we'll 
have to wait 40 years to see how the microscope becomes a popular 
tool used in science. 

In 1665 [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke) 
published [Micrographia](https://ia800504.us.archive.org/5/items/mobot31753000817897/mobot31753000817897.pdf) 
a book that inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration. His hand 
made drawings of insects and plant cells (engraved in in copperplates) popularized 
his work due to details and quality of the drawings:

<p class="post-caption">Hooke's microscope, from an engraving in Micrographia. Photo by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke#/media/File:Hooke-microscope.png">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

The engravings were very detailed, but *the most awesome feature was that you could 
unfold them making it larger than the folio itself, reinforcing the tremendous 
power of the microscope*. See for example this flea:

<p class="post-caption">Hooke's drawing of a flea. Photo by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke#/media/File:HookeFlea01.jpg">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

While these achievements are amazing, you might remember his name because he was the 
person who coined the term *cell* as the cells that he observed in a cork sample reminded
him the cells of a honeycomb.

## Microscope becomes a scientific tool

We know when the microscope was invented, when it was named and when it became popular. Now,
it's time to learn about the impact in the scientific world (and TV shows!).

In the coming years, the microscope was widely used specially in Italy, the Netherlands and 
England. The greatest contribution in this period came from [Antonie van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek) who 
has been credited as the discoverer of red blood cells, helping to popularize 
[microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy) as a technique. On 1676, 
Van Leeuwenhoek reported [the discovery of micro-organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism#History_of_microorganisms.27_discovery).

**[Side note](http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/cell/resources/blooddisc.htm)**: 
In truth, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was not the first person describing
"red particles" in blood. However, his observations were more detailed and numerous
than his predecessors ([Malpighi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Malpighi) 
and [Swammerdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Swammerdam)).


While microscopes became widely used, they faced a problem: *how to light the samples*. 

Lighting is key in microscopy in order to see the sample properly, so it was not 
until electric lamps were available as light sources that new advances and 
discoveries were made. 

After improving the lighting, scientists started to question the limits of this technology.
What's the smallest thing that you can see with it? To answer this question [August Köhler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_K%C3%B6hler) developed a key principle of sample illumination, 
the [Köhler illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination), which is central to achieving the theoretical 
[limits of light microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Limitations).  This was 1893.

Knowing the microscopy's limits, the pursue of further knowledge pushed the limits
and scientists started to use electrons instead of light and electromagnets in the 
place of glass lenses, creating the first electron microscope: the 
[transmission electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy). This was 1931.

![Polio virus image](/assets/img/blog/polio.png)
<p class="post-caption">A TEM image of the polio virus. The polio virus is 30 nm in size. Photo by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy#/media/File:Polio_EM_PHIL_1875_lores.PNG">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

Other researchers tried different techniques. For example, in the 1980s some scientists started the development of the first [scanning probe microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy).  

The first one was the [scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope) 
developed by [Gerd Binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Binnig) and 
[Heinrich Rohrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Rohrer) (1981). Five years 
later Gerd Binning, [Quate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Quate) and [Gerber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Gerber)
invented the **atomic force microscope** (AFM).

## Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)

The AFM is a big step forward because it improves the quality of the images and 
gives us access to the nanoworld. An optical microscope is limited by the 
[Abbe limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system) which is 
around 250 nm (0.25 μm). 

While this resolution allows us to see most biological cells (1 μm to 100 μm), it 
fails if you try to study viruses (100 nm), proteins (10 nm) or less complex 
molecules (1 nm). On the other hand, the AFM has a demonstrated resolution on the 
order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the optical 
diffraction limit (Abbe limit).

While these microscopes are amazing they're really expensive, around 300 thousand USD. 
This basically becomes a huge problem to educators, well, to anyone, as not many 
institutions will not have the cash to buy it.

</div>


With this problem in mind, in 2015 the [LEGO Foundation](http://www.legofoundation.com/) 
sponsored a summer school program to develop an affordable do-it-yourself (DIY) 
atomic force microscope suitable for use in schools by children. The [result](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v10/n5/full/nnano.2015.95.html) has 
been an [open source AFM](http://openafm.com/) that children can build using 
LEGO pieces, Arduino, 3D printable parts and local components. 

At the same time, [Edwin Hwu](http://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_user_en.php?id_key=94&eng=T) and his team (who are developing also the open version AFM) released
a low cost closed-source version, [the Strømlingo DIY AFM](http://www.stromlinet-nano.com/), which costs 98% less than the available
ones in the market.

These big savings make AFM affordable enabling institutions to buy cheap AFM microscopes that their
students can build themselves. Moreover, this building process only takes a few hours and the
kids could start operating it in a matter of minutes.

Due to this success, now kids will be able to see nanostructures that otherwise will be impossible with
a regular microscope. For example, particles with an [aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less](http://www3.epa.gov/pmdesignations/faq.htm)
(known as PM 2.5). Why these particles in particular? Well, because they're among the most harmful
for human health as they are small enough to penetrate deeply in the lungs and may even cross
into the blood. Scary, right?

Edwin and his team are using this particular example to show how affordable nanoscopes
can be used to analyze and take samples of these particles involving schools from all over the world. 

## Nanographia, the drawings of PM 2.5

As Robert Hooke's book Micrographia popularized microscopes, the lowcost DIY nanoscopes will enable
kids and anyone with interest in this field to write the next book that will popularize this new
type of microscopes. Studying and analyzing PM 2.5 particles, we will be able to write a book that 
will help to spread the word about this technology, as Hooke did almost 400 years ago. I've the title:
Nanographia. 

The book will describe the process to analyze these particles. It will have written instructions
about how you build the nanoscope, step by step (it could have even a virtual reality associated app
that will guide you). 

It will explain what PM2.5 particles are, as well as how you can get samples using DVD ROMs. 
Why DVDs? Because the distance between the tracks in a DVD are known (740 nanometers) and
we can see them with the AFM. Basically, you cut a DVD into pieces, put them out for a few minutes (at least 10),
get back, put them under the microscope and look for the particles. Due to the size of the particles and
the known distance between the tracks, we'll be able to identify them. 

The next chapter will be about the analysis. Once you have the samples, you will describe
how you can analyze them by hand. As this step will be slow, we'll describe how Edwin and 
his team contacted us to use our citizen science [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) 
platform to use it as a crowdsourcing solution for analyzing the samples with the crowd.

Obviously, the book will describe what's [crowdsourcing and citizen science](http://scifabric.com/blog/2016/01/27/crowdsourcing-vs-crowdfunding.html) and how you can use it for
tackling problems that machines alone cannot. It will include links to the project itself,
the [prototype](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/lego2nano/) where you 
can identify some PM 2.5 particles by drawing the area covered by them. 

If you are right now as amazed as we were the first time they contacted us and shared their story,
we couldn't resist and we proposed to [Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) 
(Madrid, Spain) to organize a workshop around it, as [we give citizen science training courses for students and teachers interested
in this field](http://scifabric.com/crowdsourcing/#education). At the end, Edwin 
visited us and showed how easily you can build an AFM microscope.

The workshop became popular and the Spanish national TV show, [La aventura del saber](http://www.rtve.es/television/la-aventura-del-saber/) (the 
adventure of knowing) interviewed us, showing how we built the microscope and analyzed
some of the samples (it starts at minute 14:00 -in Spanish):

Then, at the end of the year, [Medialab-Prado organized an open day](http://medialab-prado.es/article/festilab-1-ano-en-un-dia) where they invited the 
most relevant projects to present what we did at this venue, and I presented the workshop
in this sort talk of only 6 minutes (only in Spanish):

</div>


The built nanoscope is available in Medialab-Prado and we expect to run more workshops
like this in 2016, [where you can learn how to build your own scientific tools and use
them for your own research projects](http://scifabric.com/crowdsourcing/#education). 

By the way: High Five! You are awesome! You just read until here, so cool!
