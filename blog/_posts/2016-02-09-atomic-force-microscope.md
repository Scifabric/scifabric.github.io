Let me ask you a question: if you have to chose an image to represent science, which
one will you use? Probably a microscope (actually if you search in [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=science&biw=1535&bih=764&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio_bbKoO3KAhVIVxQKHbgjCGkQ_AUIBygC), some
of the images show you a microscope). The microscope is a tool that anyone will associate it
with science or research, but how did it happened? Why became it so popular?

Well, it became so popular thanks to Robert Hooke's book [**Micro**graphia (1665)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrographia). 
This book marked a milestone in the scientific
history as it showed to the scientific community how it could be used to analyze and study the **micro** world
with hand made drawings of cells, fleas and insects. 

Now, 351 years later we might be experiencing the writing of the next book (I've the title: **Nano**graphia) that will be a turning
point in science history again. The popularization of low cost do-it-yourself atomic force microscopes that
will allow us to explore the **nano** world. But, how did we get here? Do you know how old 
is the microscope? Let's start from the beginning.

Indeed! That's actually a long story, but worth it. Bear with me. 

## The early years of the microscope

Evidence suggests that in 1620 in Netherlands there was the first compound microscope. 
Almost 400 years ago!

While the microscope was invented, it didn't have a name. Huh! We'll have to wait 5 extra years to actually name it. In 1625 [Giovanni Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Faber) -a fellow of the [Lincean Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei)- coins the name *microscope* after [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) presented it one year before. The name comes from the Greek words μικρόν (micron) meaning "small", and σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning "to look at".

Now we know when it was named, but when did it become popular? Well, guess what, we'll 
have to wait 40 years to see how the microscope becomes a popular 
tool used in science. 

As we said before, in 1665 [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke) 
published [Micrographia (PDF)](https://ia800504.us.archive.org/5/items/mobot31753000817897/mobot31753000817897.pdf) 
a book that inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration. His hand 
made drawings of insects and plant cells (engraved in in copperplates) popularized 
his work due to details and quality of the drawings. Just check the following images!

The engravings were very detailed, but *the most awesome feature was that you could 
unfold them making it larger than the folio itself, reinforcing the tremendous 
power of the microscope*. See for example this flea:

While these achievements are amazing, you might remember his name because he was the 
person who coined the term *cell* as the cells that he observed in a cork sample reminded
him the cells of a honeycomb.

## Microscope becomes a scientific tool

We know when the microscope was invented, when it was named and when it became popular. Now,
it's time to learn about the impact in the scientific world (and TV shows!).

</div>


In the coming years, the microscope was widely used specially in Italy, the Netherlands and 
England. The greatest contribution in this period came from [Antonie van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek) who 
has been credited as the discoverer of red blood cells, helping to popularize 
[microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy) as a technique. On 1676, 
Van Leeuwenhoek reported [the discovery of micro-organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism#History_of_microorganisms.27_discovery).

**[Side note](http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/cell/resources/blooddisc.htm)**: 
In truth, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was not the first person describing
"red particles" in blood. However, his observations were more detailed and numerous
than his predecessors ([Malpighi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Malpighi) 
and [Swammerdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Swammerdam)).


While microscopes became widely used, they faced a problem: *how to light the samples*. 

Lighting is key in microscopy in order to see the sample properly, so it was not 
until electric lamps were available as light sources that new advances and 
discoveries were made. 

After improving the lighting, scientists started to question the limits of this technology.
What's the smallest thing that you can see with it? To answer this question [August Köhler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_K%C3%B6hler) developed a key principle of sample illumination, 
the [Köhler illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination), which is central to achieving the theoretical 
[limits of light microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Limitations).  This was 1893.

Knowing the microscopy's limits, the pursue of further knowledge pushed the limits
and scientists started to use electrons instead of light and electromagnets in the 
place of glass lenses, creating the first electron microscope: the 
[transmission electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy). This was 1931.

![Polio virus image](/assets/img/blog/polio.png)
<p class="post-caption">A TEM image of the polio virus. The polio virus is 30 nm in size. Photo by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy#/media/File:Polio_EM_PHIL_1875_lores.PNG">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

Other researchers tried different techniques. For example, in the 1980s some scientists started the development of the first [scanning probe microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy).  

The first one was the [scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope) 
developed by [Gerd Binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Binnig) and 
[Heinrich Rohrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Rohrer) (1981). Five years 
later Gerd Binning, [Quate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Quate) and [Gerber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Gerber)
invented the **atomic force microscope** (AFM).

## Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)

The AFM is a big step forward because it improves the quality of the images and 
gives us access to the nanoworld. An optical microscope is limited by the 
[Abbe limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system) which is 
around 250 nm (0.25 μm). 

While this resolution allows us to see most biological cells (1 μm to 100 μm), it 
fails if you try to study viruses (100 nm), proteins (10 nm) or less complex 
molecules (1 nm). On the other hand, the AFM has a demonstrated resolution on the 
order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the optical 
diffraction limit (Abbe limit).

While these microscopes are amazing they're really expensive, around 300 thousand USD. 
This basically becomes a huge problem to educators, well, to anyone, as not many 
institutions will not have the cash to buy it.

</div>

With this problem in mind, in 2015 the [LEGO Foundation](http://www.legofoundation.com/) 
sponsored a summer school program to develop an affordable do-it-yourself (DIY) 
atomic force microscope suitable for use in schools by children. The [result](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v10/n5/full/nnano.2015.95.html) has 
been an [open source AFM](http://openafm.com/) that children can build using 
LEGO pieces, Arduino, 3D printable parts and local components. 

At the same time, [Edwin Hwu](http://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_user_en.php?id_key=94&eng=T) and his team (who are developing also the open version AFM) released
a low cost closed-source version, [the Strømlingo DIY AFM](http://www.stromlinet-nano.com/), which costs 98% less than the available
ones in the market.

These big savings make AFM affordable enabling institutions to buy cheap AFM microscopes that their
students can build themselves. Moreover, this building process only takes a few hours and the
kids could start operating it in a matter of minutes.

</div>

Due to this success, now kids will be able to see nanostructures that otherwise will be impossible with
a regular microscope. For example, particles with an [aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less](http://www3.epa.gov/pmdesignations/faq.htm)
(known as PM 2.5). Why these particles in particular? Well, because they're among the most harmful
for human health as they are small enough to penetrate deeply in the lungs and may even cross
into the blood. Scary, right?

Edwin and his team are using this particular example to show how affordable nanoscopes
can be used to analyze and take samples of these particles involving schools from all over the world. 

## Nanographia, the drawings of PM 2.5

As Robert Hooke's book Micrographia popularized microscopes, the lowcost DIY nanoscopes will enable
kids and anyone with interest in this field to write the next book that will popularize this new
type of microscopes. If Micrographia was a milestone due to new discoveries in the micro world, 
affordable do-it-yourself nanoscopes will help to write the book that will make history again: Nanographia.

The book will describe how you can build the nanoscope,  and how you can use it for studying 
PM 2.5 particles. Instead of drawings, the book will feature photos showing the 
discoveries. As you can see, Nanographia will help to spread the word about this technology, as Hooke did 
almost 400 years ago. 

As with any other scientific book, there'll be a subject to be studied. In this one, the PM2.5 particles.
A chapter will explain what PM2.5 particles are, as well as how you can take samples using 
cutting pieces of DVD ROMs, as [microscope slides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide), placed
outside (for at least 10 minutes). 

Why are we going to use DVDs? Because the distance between the tracks in a DVD are known (740 nanometers) and
we can see them with the AFM. 

The next chapter will be about the analysis. Once you have the samples, it will describe
how you can analyze them by hand: calibrating the samples and measuring
the area covered by the candidate PM2.5 particles.

Incredible right? As we discovered this story, we wanted to contribute a few
chapters for the book. One about crowdsourcing as we think it could be amazing to analyze
the samples with the crowd (following the citizen science approach that this project 
already has), and a second one running workshops about the project where
you can learn, build the nanoscope, and analyze the samples with the crowd.

## SciFabric's chapters for Nanographia

Our desire to contribute to this book, became a reality when 
Edwin and his team contacted us to use our citizen science [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) 
platform for analyzing the samples with the crowd. 

This first chapter will be about citizen science, and it will describe what's 
[crowdsourcing and citizen science](http://scifabric.com/blog/2016/01/27/crowdsourcing-vs-crowdfunding.html). 
It will explain the project where anyone can analyze samples, including links to the 
[prototype](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/lego2nano/). 

Also, there will be a sub-section where we will describe the [tools that we use for building the prototype](http://pybossa.com), so others
can replicate it (like science does!).

The next chapter will be about citizen science workshops, as [we offer them to 
students and teachers](http://scifabric.com/crowdsourcing/#education) as a new way to discover
science and learn by doing. The chapter will include a new course on how you can build 
the nanoscope, use its technology and learn the citizen science approach of it.

In November 2015 we wrote the first draft. We proposed to [Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) 
(Madrid, Spain) to organize an event like this, and they accepted it.

The workshop became quite popular and the Spanish national TV show, [La aventura del saber](http://www.rtve.es/television/la-aventura-del-saber/) (the 
adventure of knowing) interviewed us, showing how we built the microscope and analyzed
some of the samples (it starts at minute 14:00 -in Spanish):

Due to the success of the workshop, we were invited by [Medialab-Prado to share at their open day event](http://medialab-prado.es/article/festilab-1-ano-en-un-dia) what we built at the workshop. In the following video you can see me talking about the project (in Spanish):

## The final chapter 

We've seen the evolution of microscopes and how human pursue of knowledge has getting 
us here. Nowadays we can build nanoscopes at home and explore the nano world in a few
hours. The possibilities are endless, but are nanoscopes the new edition of Micrographia? 
Are nanoscopes making history?

Well, I would say it's early to know, but the truth is that it has lots of potential. 

I can barely imagine how kids will be building and using this tool trying to understand what lies
in the nano world. And the best part is that we're building and exploring it together!

By the way: High Five! You are awesome! You just read until here, so cool!

Now, get away from your laptop, tablet or phone
and enjoy a beer, coffee, whatever you like. It's been a long read and you deserve it!
