Microscopes, who has not used one? Well, I hope you have, at least in your scholar years. They allow us to see things that our
bare eyes cannot, opening the door to new discoveries. But, do you know when was invented? How old is it?

As with other inventions it's difficult to know who was the inventor, but evidence points that in 1620 in Netherlands there was
the first compound microcospe. Almost 400 years ago!

In 1625 [Giovanni Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Faber), a fellow of the [Lincean Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei) coins the name *microscope* after Galileo presented it one year before. The name comes from the Greek words μικρόν (micron) meaning "small", and σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning "to look at".
However, we'll have to wait 40 years to see how the microscope becomes a popular tool used in science. In 1665 [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke) published [Micrographia](https://ia800504.us.archive.org/5/items/mobot31753000817897/mobot31753000817897.pdf) a book that inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration. His hand made drawings in copperplates of insects and plant cells made his work to become really popular due to quality of them:

The engravings actually were detailed, but the most awesome feature was that you could unfold them making it larger than the folio itself, reinforcing the tremendous power of the microscope.

Oh, yes, Hooke also coined the term *cell* as the cells reminded him the cells of honeycomb.

In the coming years, the microscope was used widely in Italy, the Netherlands and England. Marcelo Malpighi in Italy studied the biological structures of the lungs. However, the greatest contribution came from Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who discovered red blood cells and spermatozoa and helped popularise microscopy as a technique. On 1676, Van Leeuwenhoek reported the discovery of micro-organisms.

In the coming years, microscopes faced a problem: how to light the samples. It was not until electric lamps were available as light sources that new advances and discoveries were made. In 1893 August Köhler developed a key principle of sample illumination, Köhler illumination, which is central to achieving the theoretical [limits of light microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Limitations). 

Then, a big breakthrough happened, scientists started to use electrons instead of light and electromagnets in the place of glass lenses, creating the first electron microscope, the transmission electron microscope. This was 1931.

Then, in the 1980s started the development of the first scanning probe microscopes.  The first one was the scanning tunneling microscope developed by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer (1981), and then 5 years later Gerd Binning, Quate and Gerber invented the **atomic force microscope** (AFM).

The AFM is a big step forward because it improves the quality of the images and discovers the nanoworld. An optical microscope is limited by the *Abbe limit* which is around 250 nm (0.25 μm). While this resolution allows us to see most biological cells (1 μm to 100 μm), it fails if you try to study viruses (100 nm), proteins (10 nm) or less complex molecules (1 nm). On the other hand, the AFM has a demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the optical diffraction limit (Abbe limit).

While these microscopes are amazing they're really expensive, between 100~200k USD. This basically becomes a huge problem to educators all over the world, as not many institutions will be able to purchase them.

With this problem in mind, in 2015 the LEGO Foundation sponsored a summer school 
program to develop an affordable do-it-yourself (DIY) atomic force microscope suitable 
for use in schools by children. The result has been an open source AFM that children
can build using LEGO pieces, Arduino, 3D printable parts and local components. 


At the same time, Edwin Hwu and his team (who are developing also the open version AFM) released
a closed-source version, the Strømlingo DIY AFM, costing 98% less than professionals.

These big savings make AFM affordable enabling institutions to buy cheap AFM microscopes that their
students can build themselves. Moreover, this building process only takes a few hours and the
kids could start operating it in a matter of minutes.

Due to this success, now kids will be able to see nanostructures that otherwise will be impossible with
a regular microscope. For example, particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less
(known as PM 2.5). Why these particles in particular? Well, because they're among the most harmful
for human health as they are small enough to penetrate deeply in the lungs and may even cross
into the blood. Scary, right?

Edwin and his team are using this particular example to show how we affordable nanoscopes
that students can build, it will be possible to analyze and take samples of these particles
involving schools from all over the world. 

The process is really simple. Kids build their own microscope, and take samples using 
DVD ROMs. Why DVDs? Because the distance between the tracks in a DVD are known (740 nanometers) and
we can see them with the AFM. Basically, you cut a DVD into pieces, put them out for a few minutes (at least 10),
get back, put them under the microscope and look for the particles. Due to the size of the particles and
the known distance between the tracks, we'll be able to identify them. However, we have to do it
one by one, and this could be challenging as the microscope can produce images in less than 15 minutes.

At the end, analyzing the samples is done by us, persons, so Edwin and his team contacted
us to use our Crowdcrafting platform to use it as a crowdsourcing solution for analyzing the
samples with the crowd.

The result? This prototype where you can identify some 2.5PM particles by drawing the area
covered by them. It's usually easy to identify them as you can see big white blobs that
could be one of this harmful particles.

If you are as amazed as we were the first time the contacted us and shared their story,
we couldn't resist and we proposed to Medialab-Prado (Madrid, Spain) to organize a workshop
around it, as we give citizen science training courses for students and teachers interested
in this field. At the end, Edwin visited us and showed how easily you can build an AFM microscope.

The event got quite popular, and the Spanish national TV show, La aventura del saber (the 
adventure of knowing) interviewed us, showing how we built the microscope and analyzed
some of the samples (it starts at minute 14:00):

Then, at the end of the year, Medialab-Prado organized an open day where they invited the 
most relevant projects to present what we do at this venue, and I presented the workshop
in this sort talk of only 4 minutes:
