James Doherty interviews Mar Ramis, Scifabric’s new business development manager...

## Mar, where are you from?
 
I was born and bred in Palma, Mallorca but have lived outside of my little island for 
more than half of my life.

## Can you summarise your career to date?
 
My background is in media communications. I went to university in Madrid before working 
at a music label that produces children’s music. I then moved to the UK and worked in events, 
marketing and market research before moving into the TV industry, where I have worked for the past nine years.
 
## What's your favourite colour?

Green, and red, and blue, and orange, and yellow! It depends on my mood really. I love all colours, 
they all bring something different to the table.

## How did you find Scifabric?
 
Actually Scifabric found me. I have known Clara for a while and she thought that my profile 
met the requirements for this new position and voila! here I am – excited but a little terrified. 
 
## Don’t worry, we don’t bite (except Álvaro). What is your favourite Scifabric project?
 
I love [Cities at Night](http://www.citiesatnight.org/) but the one that’s closest to my 
heart for personal reasons is [Cancer Research UK’s Trailblazer](http://scifabric.com/blog/2016/04/20/Cancer-Research-UK-Trailblazer.html).

## What's your favourite food?

Mallorcan coca – a type of flatbread with veggies – in any shape or form, and gazpacho. 

## And band?

I can't pick just one. There are way too many great artists past and present. I listen to a 
variety of music from the cheesiest bands to the trendiest, independent labels and totally unknown artists. 
I enjoy listening to the radio. Right now, I'm digging The Cure.

## Have you worked for a tech start-up before?
 
Never. I’m a 100% newby in the industry – that’s what I call a challenge!

## What will the role involve?
 
My job will be to move the company towards a healthy business position, win and look after 
clients, as well as ensuring that the business side of Scifabric runs as smoothly as possible. 
I hope to help position the company as a market leader within the crowdsourcing sector.

## Why is now a good time for Scifabric to recruit you?
 
The tech market is constantly changing and evolving. In [PyBossa](http://pybossa.com/), Scifabric has a unique tool, 
so we need to show the world how amazing it is and how much it can benefit society.
 
## Do you have any pets?

Two goldfish: Peppa and George – names chosen by my two-year-old daughter.

## What’s your favourite hobby?

Pottery – I can make you a fabulous plate any time you like!

</div>

## What will be the first thing you do in the role?
 
Probably an intensive course in coding – eeeek! 

## What are you most excited about?
 
The idea of Scifabric, PyBossa and [Crowdcrafting](https://crowdcrafting.org/) helping people – directly or indirectly.

## What do you think Scifabric can achieve as a company?
 
The sky's the limit, right?
