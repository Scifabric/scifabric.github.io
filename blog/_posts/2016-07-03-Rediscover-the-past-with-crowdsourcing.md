June saw Scifabric host the ‘Rediscovering the past with Spanish technology' event at the 
National Archeological Museum of Spain. The event saw researchers from some of the UK’s 
leading humanities research institutes share their achievements of using crowd-based collaborations to reclaim human history. 
Plus they gave some handy tips on how to create meaningful and successful crowdsourcing projects.

## Micropasts

[Micropasts](http://micropasts.org/) is a collaboration between the [British Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org/) 
and [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL) that aims to create the world’s leading prehistoric metal database. 

[Dr. Chiara Bonacchi](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/honorary/bonacchi) of UCL noted that:

*“While crowdsourcing is increasingly used to support the management and interpretation of 
heritage resources, this is the first platform that focuses solely on archeology. 
Micropasts supports and develops collaborations between archives, universities, museums and 
the crowd to research our collective human past.”*

[Dr. Jennifer Wexler of](http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/departments/staff/portable_antiquities_treasure/jennifer_wexler.aspx) 
the British Museum explained the team’s motivation behind setting up the project:

*“The British Museum is home to the National Bronze Age Index: a catalogue of over 30,000 index 
cards that record all bronze age findings in the UK from the 1800s to the 1990s. This storage 
space represented a lost world – the visitor book shows that in the past 30 years only six people 
have visited the collection. We wanted to reclaim this world.”*

Using [PyBossa](http://pybossa.com/) technology, the Scifabric team built Micropasts: a platform that allows volunteers 
to transcribe the catalogue, effectively turning the information contained in 30,000 index cards 
into one of the world’s largest electronic archeological databases. Artefacts are also geographically 
referenced so that maps of their discovery sites can be generated.

Contributors were also asked to help create 3D models of some of the collection’s artefacts by a 
process known as ‘photomasking’, which involves accurately outlining the artefacts in pictures. 
The British Museum uses these models to create ‘virtual tours’ of particular artefacts. 
By annotating models online, this creates a whole new way of presenting historical objects.

## LibCrowds

The [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/) is the national library of the UK, that is, it stocks all publications in the UK – 
that’s a lot of books! It has a ‘Digital Research Team’ that aims to use computational methods to answer 
research questions, which involves the conversion of information into data.

[Nora McGregor](http://www.bl.uk/people/experts/nora-mcgregor), Digital Research Curator at the British Museum, explained the vastness of the 
library’s collection:

*“The Museum is home to a vast catalogue of index cards that describe the books in its many 
collections. For example, there are 50,000 books – each with a corresponding index card – in 
just one area of the Museum’s Chinese collection.”*

[LibCrowds](https://www.libcrowds.com/) is a crowdsourcing platform that aims to make the physical and digital collections 
of the British Library more accessible. It asks volunteers to transcribe text from printed card catalogues 
into electronic records in order to make them available to a worldwide audience. 
The project has initially focused on the Library’s Asian and African collections, particularly 
the Chinese, Indian and Indonesian catalogues. Data identified, transcribed or translated 
as part of the project is made freely accessible from the British Library’s Explore catalogue.

## Lessons learned

Several themes emerged at the event; providing insight into how to build successful crowdsourcing 
projects.

### Understand why people contribute

Dr Bonacchi described three key reasons people contribute to Micropasts:
 
1. They enjoy the aesthetic pleasure of the artefacts;
2. They like to learn about the Bronze Age;
3. They like to give back and advance scientific knowledge.

It was also noted that the more visual photomasking tasks attract younger contributors. 

One of LibCrowds' top contributors is a gentleman with a terminal illness based in California whom has stated:
 *“I love contributing to society from my bed”*.

### Work with your most enthusiastic volunteers

While Micropasts has over 1,200 contributors, they have found a small group of very motivated
 individuals make the most valuable contribution. The team has tapped into this group’s enthusiasm 
 by working closely with 100 participants through forums, social media and personal e-mail to find 
 out which historical periods they are most interested in, and asking them to complete activities 
 that require more advanced interpretation. This has been particularly successful in creating 3D 
 models of artefacts. This marks a move towards ‘upscience’, where contributors define their own research tasks.

### Use crowdsourcing to upskill your team

The Micropasts team worked closely with Scifabric in order to upskill their team to create projects. 
While Scifabric built the initial Micropasts platform, they provided the British Museum and UCL with 
the tools to develop projects autonomously. The Micropasts team has mastered PyBossa technology and 
workflows due to the simplicity of the software, good documentation and support from Scifabric's team.

### Consider your workflow

The success of a project relies heavily on creating a logical workflow that contributors can 
easily follow and that produces reliable data in a required format.

### Social media strategy

Having a sound and sustained social media strategy is vital to a project’s success both to 
attract new contributors and to keep projects fresh in the mind of existing volunteers. 
Dr Wexler confessed she found this to be the most fun part of the project.

### Sustaining participation

While projects can attract a great deal of attention at their inception, it is a challenge 
to sustain participation. As well as a sound social media strategy, other suggested techniques 
are to write a research blog with dedicated research resources, explore more practical, collaborative 
and rewarding methods of participation, and tap into offline communities, such as archeological societies. 
Press releases also help to drive traffic to projects. Involving PhD students or interns to push presence 
online is also helpful.

### Plug-ins

Nora McGregor believes *“plug-ins are really important. Having code that conveniently plugs 
into your database makes the project much more efficient. We keep everything open source, 
so our plug-ins are available on Github"*.

### Keep it open

Both LibCrowds and Micropasts make all their data open, including raw data, partly analysed 
data and fully analysed data. This maximises the collaborative nature of the projects and 
enriches resources available to the global research community. For example, Micropasts 
3D-modelled artefacts may be 3D-printed and studied by anyone around the world – a practice 
that may revolutionise archeology. (Read about our views on [Open Science here](http://scifabric.com/blog/2016/03/27/Open-Science.html).)

We’d like to thank Nora, Chiara and Jennifer for taking time out to visit us in Madrid, sharing 
their experiences, and helping us to grow the crowdsourcing community. 

The event was also the first time the whole Scifabric team got together in one geographical location. Aren't we gorgeous... ?
