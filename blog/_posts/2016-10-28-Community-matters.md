Scifabric hosts many citizen science and public participation projects. We’ve noticed
the best projects have one thing in common: **successful community engagement**. Whether, like
 [Cities at Night](https://scifabric.com/success-stories/citiesatnight/), you require tens 
 of thousands of volunteers or perhaps only a handful,
  like the [Iceland Criminal Court project](http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/2015/09/07/Data-mining.html), 
  the success of a crowdsourcing project lies in its ability to 
  engage with a dedicated community. [PYBOSSA](http://pybossa.com/) 
  software provides the tools to build thriving communities.

## A head start

Citizen science lends itself to community engagement because it is collaborative and constructive by nature. 
Dr. Crispin Butteriss, Chief Practice Officer at online community engagement specialists [Bang the Table](http://www.bangthetable.com/),
 states that “if you can get your community 
to build or create something together, something that is bigger than themselves, and critically, 
if you can make it fun, you are likely to get people engaged”.


## What’s in it for the volunteers?

Citizen science is a mutually beneficial exercise. While many hands make light work for 
project owners, participants enjoy a sense of place and belonging, and gain an opportunity 
to become a valued citizen of a community. Stewardship naturally follows: volunteers care 
about what they are observing and their community. This can offer a sense of self-importance 
to individuals who become valuable contributors to a larger research effort. This may also 
provide volunteers with a deeper interest in the research topic.

## How to build a community

We’ve talked to owners of some of our most successful projects, including 
[MicroPasts](https://scifabric.com/success-stories/micropasts/) and 
[LibCrowds](https://scifabric.com/blog/2016/05/24/Rediscover-the-past-with-crowdsourcing.html), 
and paraphrased a few of Dr. Butteriss’
 [recommendations](http://www.bangthetable.com/lessons-from-citizen-science-for-community-engagement-practice/), 
 to provide seven tips on how to build a strong community:

### Understand motivations

The better you understand your contributor’s motivations, the better you can cater to their 
needs and maintain engagement. In the case of archeology project MicroPasts, key motivators 
include: the desire to learn or get training, the aesthetic pleasure of looking at archeological 
collections, the will to give back to a museum that was dear to them, the social motivation of 
helping out and contributing to advance scientific knowledge.

### Trust and common goal setting

The more trust between volunteers and project leaders, the more successful a project is in 
maintaining volunteer interest. Discussing roles, responsibilities and expected outcomes 
openly and periodically helps to facilitate a positive rapport. Project owners should increase 
volunteers’ understanding of project goals by clearly communicating the project mission and achievements.

### Mentor your most enthusiastic volunteers

Volunteers appreciate the opportunity to acquire new skills and develop relationships with 
project leaders. For example, Micropasts worked closely with a small group of motivated 
individuals to [complete activities that require more advanced interpretation](https://scifabric.com/blog/2016/05/24/Rediscover-the-past-with-crowdsourcing.html). Similarly, 
Cancer Research UK provided a dedicated group of volunteers with 25 minutes of training 
that allowed them to [detect cancer cells with 95% accuracy](https://scifabric.com/blog/2016/04/20/Cancer-Research-UK-Trailblazer.html).

### Communication strategy

Having a sound communication strategy is vital to a project’s success, both to attract new 
contributors and keep it fresh in the mind of existing volunteers. Project owners should 
aim to create an interactive and cohesive online community. This might include a sustained 
social media campaign, a research blog with dedicated research resources, or press releases 
that drive traffic to projects. Oh, and 
[appearing on Fox News](http://linkeddata4.dia.fi.upm.es/wordpress-multi/cities-at-night/on-the-news/) 
doesn’t half help...

### Convenience and flexibility

Volunteers need to be able to contribute when and how they want. Tasks should be relatively 
simple to begin with an opportunity of increased sophistication as a volunteer’s skills improve. 
Different people with various skills, time and knowledge will require different participation
 opportunities.

### Spreading the word

Volunteers can become increasingly interested in educating the broader community about 
issues underpinning project goals.

### Acknowledgement

Participants expect to be acknowledged for their contribution.

## PYBOSSA: Community-centred software

Scifabric recognises the importance of community and so we have developed a range of
 [PYBOSSA](http://pybossa.com/) [features](http://pybossa.com/features/) 
to help project owners grow their own communities:

**Blog** – each project has its own blog to share updates about the research, because sharing is caring…

**Newsletters** – users can integrate their projects with MailChimp to provide regular updates to their communities.

**Social Login** – users can sign in with Google, Facebook or Twitter credentials seamlessly, 
making it easier to create, or tap into, communities on these social fora.

**TwitterBot** – we’re working on a lovely TwitterBot that will take the tedium out of Tweeting.

**Notifications** – our webhooks triggers provide real-time analysis, so you can know exactly 
how active your community is. Do they need a little nudge to complete a particular task?

**Open Science** – every aspect of PYBOSSA is accessible to everyone. People are more likely 
to contribute to open, honest projects. Open science done properly!

**Crowdcrafting** – projects can be built on our [Crowdcrafting](/crowdcrafting) platform, 
which boasts a substantial existing community.

## Community matters

We know that community matters, so why not use some of our [open source tools](http://pybossa.com/features/) to help build one around your data analysis project. It may be your first step to something very worthwhile...
