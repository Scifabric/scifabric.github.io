    <h3>Cities at Night is a research that aims to raise awareness of light pollution and provide tools for monitoring it. </h3>
    <p>It is led by Complutense University of Madrid and Sherbrooke CEGEP in collaboration with NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), as well as various other institutions and collectives.</p>

    <h3>Scifabric developed and implemented a customised Crowdcrafting project for Cities at Night, making the platform suitable for this specific research.</h3>
    <p>We provided full time support and maintenance for this and two further projects, as well as creating tutorials to show how volunteers could participate.</p>

    <h3>Cities at Night aims to classify, identify and geo-reference images taken by astronauts from the International Space Station.</h3>
    <p>These are the only images available of the Earth at night in color and high resolution.</p>

            <h3>Cities at Night consists of three projects, each with a unique but related purpose.</h3>
            <p>At Scifabric we created Dark Skies, the first Cities At Night project and also advised on the development of the follow-up Lost At Night and Night Cities ISS projects. The first Dark Skies prototype was created in less than an hour, which proved to the researchers how easy Crowdcrafting is to use.</p>

            <h5 id="3" class="count circle">Three</h5>
            <h3>In Dark Skies project, contributors classify what can be observed in images, whether that’s cities, stars, lights or other objects.</h3>
            <h5>And counting</h5>
            <p>This project is a classic image pattern recognition problem where the volunteers identify objects that algorithms have trouble with. In this case, identifying stars, cities at night, auroras borealis, etc. is quite complex for computers while people can do it with a simple glimpse. This project was the fir</p>

            <h5 id="2" class="count circle">two</h5>
            <h3>In the Lost At Night project, volunteers identify particular cities in the photographs</h3>
            <h5>And counting</h5>
            <p>This second project shows how PyBossa technology may be used for georeferencing. The project uses web maps to geolocate the cities shown in the images, saving the latitude and longitude of particular features.</p>

            <h5 id="1" class="count circle">One</h5>
            <h3>In Night Cities ISS the purpose is to accurately georeference the location of cities, that is, associate the cities on the pictures with locations in physical space.</h3>
            <h5>And counting</h5>
            <p class="last-p">Finally, building on previous work, the aim of this project is pinpoint the exact location of city features in the images. It uses advanced web-mapping techniques, like allowing users to rotate images on top of a web map to mark points that will identify the city shown on the picture. This facilitates accurate georeferencing of the city.</p>

    <h3>The project has so far attracted more than 30,000 unique contributors on all three projects. Thanks to users more than 145,000 images have now been classified, located and georeferenced.</h3>
    <p>A tutorial shows users how to contribute,
 tasks to complete and gives step by step information. 
Therefore, anyone interested can collaborate 
with no prior information or notions.</p>

        <h3>Our experience with the Crowdcrafting platform has been overwhelmingly positive.</h3>
        <p class="opinion"> It has allowed us to launch several citizen science projects 
        with very few resources and no effort. The platform is flexible 
        enough to use templates or create custom applications. 
        It was a solution that allowed us to only worry about science and 
        no other technical or non scientific issues.</p>

        <p class="opinion">In addition, the team has always been involved 
        and available to give advise and maintain uninterrupted service.</p>
