                <h1 class="title is-1 has-text-primary hightlight">What was Crowdcrafting?</h1>
                <p>Crowdcrafting was a web-based service that invited volunteers
                to contribute to scientific projects developed by citizens,
                professionals or institutions that needed help to solve problems,
                analyze data or complete challenging tasks that couldn't be done by
                machines alone, but required human intelligence. The platform
                was 100% open source built on top of PYBOSSA and 100%
                open-science making scientific research accessible to everyone.</p>

                    origins</h2>
                <p>Crowdcrafting was born at a hackathon in Cape Town, South
                Africa in 2011. It was a free and open source alternative to
                existing citizen science platforms. In partnership with key
                collaborators, such as CERN, United Nations (UNITAR), the
                University of Geneva, and Open Knowledge International we 
                reached out to and inspired many people to get involved with
                science.</p>

                <p>Eight years later, we feel that we need to focus more on
                PYBOSSA technology than on the free platform.</p>

                <p>During these years we had really cool projects in the
                platform. We had <strong>more than 54 thousand users, more than 1.5 
                million tasks uploaded by the community and more than 2.5 million classifications or
                analysis done by you, the people behind Crowdcrafting.</strong></p>

                <p>Crowdcrafting has been the home for more than 3 thousand
                projects created by citizens, researchers and institutions from
                all over the world.</p>

                <p>During these years, one of the features that allowed people
                to easily create a research project, was our project wizard.</p>

                <p>The wizard basically asked you a few questions, and without
                writing a single line of code, the user would have a project up
                and running within minutes. Here is an example about how you
                could analyze a set of pictures with the crowd:</p>
