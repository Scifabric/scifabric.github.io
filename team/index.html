            We are a new technologies' company that develops incredibly versatile tools for collection, analysis and data enrichment using crowd-based methodologies such as citizen science and crowdsourcing, all thanks to PYBOSSA. <a href="http://pybossa.com">PYBOSSA</a> is our technology, our product.</p>
            <!--<p><a href="http://pybossa.com">PYBOSSA</a> is our main product. Creating a PYBOSSA server from scratch can cost up to 500.000 EUR and 7 full time developers. Well, we have that already built and ready for our clients to use it <strong>for free</strong>.</p>

            <h4>With us you’ll save time and money</h4>
            <p>Example, Cities At Night had ~200.000 images to classify, which needed 5 people each, resulting in 1.000.000 tasks. They had 18.000 people helping, using only 2,94 avg secs per task. As a result, in just one month 100.000 images were classified at ZERO EUR.</p>
            <h4>You will find nothing like our technology out there</h4>
            <p>With Scifabric you can keep your data private, or make it public. It’s extensible, customisable, allows real time analysis and full text search support via API, and offers a content management system (CMS) along with integrations with importers and hardware, to name a few.</p>-->
